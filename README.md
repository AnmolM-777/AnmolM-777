## 🧠 About Me

I’m a CS undergrad at IIT Jodhpur, exploring how software connects with
**finance, systems, and real-world engineering**.

Right now I’m actively learning and experimenting with:

- ⚙️ backend & web systems
- 📈 quantitative thinking + financial modeling
- ₿ bitcoin + crypto fundamentals (protocols, not hype)
- 🧠 AI / ML basics and practical use-cases
- 🌍 open-source collaboration and tooling

## 🚀 Focus Areas (what I’m trying to get good at)

### 🔷 Quant & Markets
- basic risk/return models  
- probability, statistics, time-series intuition  
- experimenting with small backtests + simulations  
- writing clean, reproducible code for experiments

### ₿ Bitcoin / Blockchain (tech side)
- how bitcoin actually works (consensus, mempool, UTXO, nodes)
- reading protocol docs instead of chasing tokens
- understanding on-chain data and analytics
- security + transparency concepts

> curious about open-source finance systems that are transparent and verifiable.

### 🤖 AI / ML
- ML fundamentals (linear models, regression, intro DL)
- PyTorch basics
- practical tools — not just buzzwords

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**languages**
- C, C++
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Python (ML + scripting)
- Rust (learning)

**web**
- React • Tailwind • Vite
- clean UI / component-based design

**dev tools**
- Git & GitHub
- Docker
- Linux

**data / math**
- probability & statistics
- matrices, numerical methods
- time-series intuition

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- structured backend design
- reproducible research workflows
- reading whitepapers + docs (bitcoin / systems papers)
- contributing meaningfully to open-source

---

## 🤝 Open Source

I’m especially interested in contributing to:

- financial / quant open-source tooling
- bitcoin / protocol education projects
- developer tooling and docs
- ML utilities

If you’re building something cool — I’m happy to help, learn, and collaborate.
