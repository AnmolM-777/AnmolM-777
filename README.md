##  About Me

I’m a CS undergrad at IIT Jodhpur, exploring how software connects with
**finance, systems, and real-world engineering**.

Right now I’m actively learning and experimenting with:

-  backend & web systems
- quantitative thinking + financial modeling
- bitcoin + crypto fundamentals (protocols, not hype)
-  AI / ML basics and practical use-cases
-  open-source collaboration and tooling

Portfolio (interactive):

## Focus Areas (what I’m trying to get good at)

###  Quant & Markets
- basic risk/return models  
- probability, statistics, time-series intuition  
- experimenting with small backtests + simulations  
- writing clean, reproducible code for experiments

###  Bitcoin / Blockchain (tech side)
- how bitcoin actually works (consensus, mempool, UTXO, nodes)
- reading protocol docs instead of chasing tokens
- understanding on-chain data and analytics
- security + transparency concepts

> curious about open-source finance systems that are transparent and verifiable.

###  AI / ML
- ML fundamentals (linear models, regression, intro DL)
- PyTorch basics
- practical tools — not just buzzwords

---

##  Tech Stack

**languages**
- C, C++
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Python (ML + scripting)
- Rust (learning)

**web**
- React • Tailwind • Vite
- clean UI / component-based design

**dev tools**
- Git & GitHub
- Docker
- Linux

**data / math**
- probability & statistics
- matrices, numerical methods
- time-series intuition

---

##  Featured Projects (with context)

### 🌌 NEXUS — Astronomy Club Website
Interactive website for IIT Jodhpur astronomy club.
- multi-page React app
- Tailwind-based UI system
- Three.js space animation elements
- collaborative Git workflow (PRs, branches)

> goal: build something real that people actually use.

---

### 👤 Interactive Portfolio
Terminal-style personal website.
- modular UI components
- keyboard-driven interactions
- clean routing + file structure
- deployed frontend

Live: https://my-portfolio-tech-eight.vercel.app/

---

### 🧮 Matrix Calculator (C)
Command-line computation engine:
- addition, transpose, adjoint, inverse
- structured validation + reusable functions
- focus on correctness + testing

---

### 📈 Quant Experiments (WIP)
Small notebooks + experiments:
- time-series intuition
- simple backtests
- readable code + comments

## Currently Learning

- structured backend design
- reproducible research workflows
- reading whitepapers + docs (bitcoin / systems papers)
- contributing meaningfully to open-source

---

## Open Source

I’m especially interested in contributing to:

- financial / quant open-source tooling
- bitcoin / protocol education projects
- developer tooling and docs
- ML utilities

If you’re building something cool — I’m happy to help, learn, and collaborate.
